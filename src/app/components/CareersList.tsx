            <li>üíª Enterprise SaaS talent management / resourcing platform</li>
            <li>üíµ Raised $1m from investors to scale and grow product offering</li>

          <p>
            Atellio (initially called Stitch)  is an enterprise SaaS platform that allows companies to manage their talent and crew. It was born out of our insights from Easle, where customers on Easle would ask about white labelling the platform for their own talent management needs. Within 2 weeks of building a prototype, we had our first paying customer.
          </p>
          <p>
            We soon found traction within the retail and fashion space, where large companies would struggle to wrangle together their talent into one coherent system. We worked alongside these companies to extend the product offering. Our system build bespoke features for shortlisting, booking, budgeting and assigning talent to photo and video productions.
          </p>
          <p>
            In its peak we got to just shy of $1m in annual recurring revenue, with customers like Nike, Walmart, Nordstrom and REI to name a few. Serving 100‚Äôs of users within these customers to manage their fluid workforce across high velocity projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            We soon struggled to grow beyond that as our offering was highly specific to photo / video production which only provided enough value to very large enterprise customers. The platform is currently being maintained to serve it‚Äôs existing customers.

            Dojo was a city discovery app that aimed to capture the zeitgeist of London. It quickly became a hot pocket within London where for most millennials it was customary to have both Citymapper and Dojo to be considered a ‚ÄúLondoner‚Äù.

          <p>
            With its user base quickly growing, I was brought on to re-design and develop their newsletter builder, being one of its key marketing channels serving 100k+ subscribers. Alongside this, with the app snapping up design awards, I worked with the founding designer to translate the design to the web, allowing users without the app to access the good stuff.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unfortunately, the app shut down a few years later, leaving all wannabe London trendsetters anxious in having to revert back to more vanilla apps like Timeout.

            Orderswift started out as a food order and delivery app, much like we see Deliveroo and Uber eats today, but quickly moved into the bespoke restaurant solution of click and collect ordering. Deliveroo at the time was just starting out, and I wonder what would have been if we competed head to head. Would Orderoo have been the go to? Who knows...
          </p>
          <p>
            I worked with the founders to conceptualise, wireframe, design and build the food ordering experience from the ground up. This included the customer facing menu and checkout system, as well as the restaurant application to receive and manage the orders coming through our system.
          </p>
          <p>
            The business continues on today serving customers across a number of high street chains.
